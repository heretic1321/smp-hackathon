# Boss Animation Speed Control

## ✅ Feature Added

The boss now has **independent control** over animation speed, allowing for a slow, menacing walk during the initial approach that automatically speeds up to normal during combat.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### Two Animation Speeds:

1. **Menacing Walk (Simple Behaviour):**
   - Movement speed: Slow (default 1.5)
   - Animation speed: Slower (default 0.5x = 50% speed)
   - Result: Slow, deliberate, intimidating approach

2. **Combat (Complex Behaviour):**
   - Movement speed: Fast (run/sprint)
   - Animation speed: Normal (1.0x = 100% speed)
   - Result: Fast, aggressive combat animations

---

## 🎛️ Inspector Setup

### BossAIController → Movement Speed Settings:

```
Movement Speed Settings:
├─ Menacing Walk Speed: 1.5 (movement speed)
├─ Menacing Animation Speed: 0.5 (animation speed multiplier) ✅ NEW!
├─ Normal Walk Speed: 2.5
├─ Running Speed: 4.5
└─ Sprint Speed: 6.0
```

### Menacing Animation Speed Slider:
- **Range:** 0.1 to 1.0
- **Default:** 0.5 (50% speed)
- **Lower = Slower = More menacing**

## 🎨 Animation Speed Examples

### 0.3x (Very Slow):
- **Effect:** Extremely menacing, almost slow-motion
- **Use Case:** Horror-style boss, maximum intimidation
- **Movement:** 1.5 speed feels like crawling

### 0.5x (Slow) - DEFAULT:
- **Effect:** Menacing and deliberate
- **Use Case:** Balanced intimidation and gameplay
- **Movement:** 1.5 speed feels appropriately slow

### 0.7x (Moderately Slow):
- **Effect:** Slightly slower than normal
- **Use Case:** Less dramatic, more natural
- **Movement:** 1.5 speed feels like cautious walk

### 1.0x (Normal):
- **Effect:** Standard animation speed
- **Use Case:** No slow-motion effect
- **Movement:** 1.5 speed feels like normal walk

## 🔧 Technical Details

### What Gets Controlled:

**Movement Speed (Invector AI Motor):**
- `walkSpeed`, `runningSpeed`, `sprintSpeed`
- Controls how fast the boss moves in world space

**Animation Speed (Unity Animator):**
- `animator.speed` property
- Controls how fast animations play
- Independent of movement speed

### Automatic Switching:

**When Boss Activates:**
```csharp
SetMenacingWalkSpeed();      // Set slow movement
SetMenacingAnimationSpeed(); // Set slow animation (0.5x)
```

**When Switching to Simple Behaviour:**
```csharp
SetMenacingWalkSpeed();      // Set slow movement
SetMenacingAnimationSpeed(); // Set slow animation (0.5x)
```

**When Switching to Complex Behaviour:**
```csharp
SetFullCombatSpeed();           // Set fast movement
RestoreNormalAnimationSpeed();  // Set normal animation (1.0x)
```

## 🎮 Testing

### Quick Test:

1. **Enter Play Mode**
2. **Skip to Boss Phase** (GameManager debug menu)
3. **Watch Cinematic**
4. **After Cinematic:**
   - Boss walks slowly toward player ✅
   - Walk animation plays at 50% speed ✅
   - Looks menacing and deliberate ✅
5. **When Boss Gets Close:**
   - Boss switches to complex behaviour ✅
   - Animation speed returns to 100% ✅
   - Combat animations play at normal speed ✅

### Expected Console Output:

```
BossAIController: Boss activated with simple behaviour
BossAIController: Set menacing walk speed (1.5)
BossAIController: Set menacing animation speed to 0.5x ✅

[Boss approaches player...]

BossAIController: Switched to complex behaviour
BossAIController: Set full combat speed (run: 4.5, sprint: 6)
BossAIController: Restored normal animation speed (1.0x) ✅
```

## 🎯 Recommended Settings

### For Maximum Menace:
- **Menacing Walk Speed:** 1.0 (very slow)
- **Menacing Animation Speed:** 0.3 (very slow animation)
- **Result:** Extremely intimidating, horror-style

### For Balanced Gameplay (DEFAULT):
- **Menacing Walk Speed:** 1.5 (slow)
- **Menacing Animation Speed:** 0.5 (slow animation)
- **Result:** Menacing but not frustratingly slow

### For Faster Approach:
- **Menacing Walk Speed:** 2.0 (moderate)
- **Menacing Animation Speed:** 0.7 (slightly slow)
- **Result:** Less dramatic, quicker to combat

## 💡 Creative Tips

### Syncing Animation to Movement:

If the boss appears to be "sliding" or "moonwalking":

**Problem:** Animation speed doesn't match movement speed

**Solution:** Adjust both values proportionally:
- Movement 1.5 + Animation 0.5 = Good match ✅
- Movement 1.0 + Animation 0.3 = Good match ✅
- Movement 2.0 + Animation 0.7 = Good match ✅

### For Dramatic Effect:

1. **Start with very slow animation (0.3x)**
2. **Use slow movement (1.0)**
3. **Long approach distance** (player sees boss coming)
4. **Build tension with music**
5. **Sudden speed increase** when switching to combat

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Boss Animations Too Fast During Approach

**Fix:** Decrease "Menacing Animation Speed" slider
- Try 0.4 or 0.3 for slower effect

### Boss Animations Too Slow During Combat

**Check:** Complex behaviour should restore to 1.0x
- Console should show "Restored normal animation speed (1.0x)"
- If not, check `SwitchToComplexBehaviour()` is being called

### Boss Appears to Slide/Moonwalk

**Cause:** Animation speed and movement speed don't match

**Fix:** Adjust both proportionally:
- If movement is 1.5, try animation 0.5
- If movement is 1.0, try animation 0.3

### Animation Speed Not Changing

**Check:**
- [ ] Animator component is assigned
- [ ] Console shows animation speed messages
- [ ] Animator.speed is not being overridden elsewhere

## 📊 Comparison

| State | Movement Speed | Animation Speed | Effect |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Menacing Walk** | 1.5 | 0.5x (50%) | Slow, intimidating |
| **Combat** | 4.5+ | 1.0x (100%) | Fast, aggressive |

---

## ✅ Benefits

1. **More Intimidating:** Slow animation makes boss feel powerful and menacing
2. **Better Pacing:** Builds tension during approach, excitement during combat
3. **Professional Polish:** Smooth transition between states
4. **Easy to Tune:** Single slider to adjust menace level
5. **Automatic:** No manual scripting needed, handles itself

---

## 🎬 Cinematic Effect

The slow animation creates a "boss entrance" effect:
- Player sees boss approaching slowly
- Boss looks unstoppable and menacing
- Builds anticipation and tension
- When combat starts, speed increase is dramatic
- Creates memorable boss encounter
