## üéõÔ∏è Customizable Settings

### In GameManager Inspector:

**Boss Fight Setup ‚Üí Boss Roar Delay**
- **Range:** 0 to 5 seconds
- **Default:** 1.5 seconds
- **Slider:** Easy to adjust in inspector

### Recommended Values:

- **0.5s:** Very quick roar (right at start)
- **1.0s:** Quick roar (good for short cinematics)
- **1.5s:** Default (balanced timing) ‚úÖ
- **2.0s:** Delayed roar (dramatic build-up)
- **3.0s:** Late roar (for longer cinematics)

---

## üîß How It Works

### Old Behavior (WRONG):
```
1. Cinematic plays completely
2. Cinematic ends
3. THEN roar triggers ‚ùå
4. Boss activates
```

### New Behavior (CORRECT):
```
1. Cinematic starts
2. Wait [Boss Roar Delay] seconds
3. Roar triggers DURING cinematic ‚úÖ
4. Cinematic continues
5. Cinematic ends
6. Boss activates
```

## üéØ Timing Coordination

### Match Roar Delay to Your Cinematic:

**If your cinematic poses are:**
- Pose 1: Wide shot (1s transition + 1.5s hold) = 2.5s total
- **Set roar delay to 1.5-2.0s** (roars during/after wide shot)

**If you want roar on specific pose:**
- Pose 1: 0-2s
- Pose 2: 2-4s  
- Pose 3: 4-6s
- **Set delay to match when you want roar**

---

## üí° Tips

### For Dramatic Effect:
1. **Wide shot** (0-2s): Show full boss
2. **Roar at 1.5s:** Boss roars during wide shot
3. **Zoom to face** (2-4s): Close-up of roaring boss
4. **Player reaction** (4-5s): Show player

### For Quick Action:
1. Set roar delay to **0.5s** (immediate roar)
2. Short cinematic poses (0.5s transitions)
3. Total cinematic: 3 seconds
4. Quick transition to combat

### For Epic Build-up:
1. Long slow approach shots
2. Set roar delay to **2.5-3s** (late roar)
3. Roar happens at climax of cinematic
4. Longer total cinematic (6-8 seconds)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Roar Happens Too Early
- **Increase** Boss Roar Delay value
- Default 1.5s ‚Üí Try 2.0s or 2.5s

### Roar Happens Too Late
- **Decrease** Boss Roar Delay value
- Default 1.5s ‚Üí Try 1.0s or 0.5s

### Roar Animation Not Playing
- Check Roar Animator is assigned
- Check Roar Animator has "Roar" trigger
- Check roar animation is in animator controller

### Roar SFX Not Playing
- Check Boss Roar SFX AudioClip is assigned
- Check AudioManager exists
- Check audio volumes are not 0

## üìä Default Configuration

**Recommended Setup:**
- Boss Roar Delay: **1.5 seconds**
- Total Cinematic: **5 seconds**
- Pose 1: 0.5s transition + 1.5s hold = 2s
- Pose 2: 1.5s transition + 1.5s hold = 3s (roar happens here)
- Pose 3: 1.0s transition + 1.0s hold = 2s

**Result:** Roar happens during transition to Pose 2 (medium shot)

**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and Customizable
**Location:** GameManager.cs ‚Üí Boss Fight Setup section
**Default Value:** 1.5 seconds
