## üö® Common Mistakes

1. **‚ùå Forgot to assign Simple Behaviour**
   - Boss doesn't move after cinematic
   - Fix: Assign SimpleBossBehaviour in BossAIController

2. **‚ùå Assigned Complex Behaviour to Simple slot**
   - Boss attacks immediately
   - Fix: Swap behaviours (Simple = walk only, Complex = combat)

3. **‚ùå Poses not positioned**
   - Camera doesn't move
   - Fix: Move pose GameObjects in scene view

4. **‚ùå No EnemyDeathNotifier on boss**
   - Boss death doesn't trigger victory
   - Fix: Add EnemyDeathNotifier component to boss

5. **‚ùå Combat distance too high**
   - Boss switches to complex too early
   - Fix: Set Combat Activation Distance to 5-10 units
