# Barrier System - FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Wrong

### Issue 1: Phase 2 Barrier Disappearing Too Early
**Problem:** Barrier was being disabled when transitioning TO Phase 3, not when enemies were defeated in Phase 2.

**Old behavior:**
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 (barrier enabled)
Player walks to Phase 3 trigger
Phase 3 starts (barrier disabled) ❌ WRONG!
```

**What should happen:**
```
Phase 1 → Phase 2 (barrier enabled)
Kill all Phase 2 enemies
Barrier opens automatically ✅
Player walks to Phase 3 trigger
Phase 3 starts
```

### Issue 2: Phase 4 Barrier Not Opening
**Problem:** Same issue - barrier was being disabled on phase transition, not on enemy defeat.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Fix 1: Barriers Now Open on Enemy Defeat

Updated `OnEnemyDefeated()` method to:
1. Track enemy defeats per phase
2. When all enemies in phase defeated → **Open barrier immediately**
3. Log clear messages for debugging

**New Code:**
```csharp
case GamePhase.Phase2:
    enemiesDefeatedPhase2++;
    
    // Check if all enemies defeated
    if (enemiesDefeatedPhase2 >= phase2EnemyCount)
    {
        Debug.Log("GameManager: Phase 2 COMPLETE - All enemies defeated!");
        
        // Open barrier immediately
        if (phase2Barrier != null && phase2Barrier.activeSelf)
        {
            phase2Barrier.SetActive(false);
            Debug.Log("GameManager: Phase 2 barrier OPENED - player can proceed!");
        }
    }
    break;
```

Same logic for Phase 4!

### Fix 2: Added Safety Checks

Phase 3 and Boss Fight setup now have backup checks:
- If barrier is still active when entering next phase → disable it
- This ensures barriers don't stay stuck if something goes wrong

## 🎮 How It Works Now

### Phase 2 Flow

```
1. Player enters Phase 2 trigger
   ↓
2. GameManager.SetupPhase2()
   - Barrier ENABLED ✅
   - Enemies spawn ✅
   - Music changes ✅
   ↓
3. Player kills enemies
   ↓
4. Each enemy death calls GameManager.OnEnemyDefeated()
   - Counter increments: 1/3, 2/3, 3/3
   ↓
5. Last enemy dies (3/3)
   - Barrier OPENS automatically ✅
   - Console: "Phase 2 barrier OPENED - player can proceed!"
   ↓
6. Player walks to Phase 3 trigger
   ↓
7. Phase 3 starts (barrier already open)
```

### Phase 4 Flow

```
1. Player enters Phase 4 trigger
   ↓
2. GameManager.SetupPhase4()
   - Barrier ENABLED ✅
   - Enemies spawn ✅
   - Music changes ✅
   ↓
3. Player kills enemies
   ↓
4. Each enemy death calls GameManager.OnEnemyDefeated()
   - Counter increments: 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5
   ↓
5. Last enemy dies (5/5)
   - Barrier OPENS automatically ✅
   - Console: "Phase 4 barrier OPENED - player can proceed!"
   ↓
6. Player walks to Boss trigger
   ↓
7. Boss phase starts (barrier already open)
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues

### Issue: Barrier Opens Immediately

**Symptom:** Barrier disappears as soon as Phase 2/4 starts

**Causes:**
1. Enemy count is set to 0 in GameManager
2. No enemies are spawning
3. Enemies don't have EnemyDeathNotifier component

**Fix:**
- Check GameManager → Phase 2 Enemy Count (should be 3+)
- Check GameManager → Phase 4 Enemy Count (should be 5+)
- Check enemy prefabs have EnemyDeathNotifier component

### Issue: Barrier Never Opens

**Symptom:** Kill all enemies but barrier stays closed

**Causes:**
1. Enemies don't have EnemyDeathNotifier component
2. Enemy death not calling GameManager
3. Enemy count mismatch (spawned 3, but count set to 5)

**Fix:**
- Add EnemyDeathNotifier to all enemy prefabs
- Check console for "Enemy defeated" messages
- Make sure Phase X Enemy Count matches actual spawned enemies

### Issue: Barrier Disappears Before Enemies Spawn

**Symptom:** Enter phase, barrier appears then immediately disappears

**Causes:**
1. Enemies spawning instantly and dying
2. Enemy count is 0
3. Barrier being disabled elsewhere

**Fix:**
- Check enemy prefabs are valid
- Check spawn points are positioned correctly
- Check enemy count is > 0
