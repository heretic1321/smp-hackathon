# FadeText UI Integration Guide

## ✅ Feature Added

The GameManager now displays messages on the `fadeText` UI element:
- **"Boss Defeated!"** - When boss dies
- **"Double Swords added to inventory"** - When loot is collected

---

## 📋 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Assign fadeText to GameManager

1. **Select GameManager** GameObject in hierarchy
2. **Find "UI References" section** in Inspector
3. **Drag the fadeText element** from Canvas/HUD/fadeText to the **Fade Text** field
4. **Fade Text Display Duration:** 3 seconds (default, adjustable)

### Visual:

```
GameManager Inspector:
├─ ... (other sections)
├─ UI References:
│  ├─ Fade Text: [Drag Canvas/HUD/fadeText here] ✅
│  └─ Fade Text Display Duration: 3
```

---

### Step 2: Configure Loot Item Names

Each loot prefab can have a custom display name:

1. **Select your loot prefab** (e.g., DoubleSwordLoot)
2. **Find LootPickup component**
3. **Set "Item Name"** field (e.g., "Double Swords")

### Visual:

```
LootPickup Component:
├─ Item Info:
│  └─ Item Name: "Double Swords" ✅
├─ Pickup Settings:
│  ├─ Auto Pickup: ✅
│  └─ ... (other settings)
```

## 🎬 How It Works

### When Boss is Defeated:

```
Boss Dies
    ↓
GameManager.OnBossDefeated() called
    ↓
ShowFadeText("Boss Defeated!") ✅
    ↓
fadeText appears at top of screen
    ↓
Stays visible for 3 seconds
    ↓
Fades out over 1 second
    ↓
Text disappears
```

### When Loot is Collected:

```
Player touches loot
    ↓
LootPickup.CollectLoot() called
    ↓
GameManager.OnLootCollected(gameObject, "Double Swords")
    ↓
ShowFadeText("Double Swords added to inventory") ✅
    ↓
fadeText appears at top of screen
    ↓
Stays visible for 3 seconds
    ↓
Fades out over 1 second
    ↓
Text disappears
```

---

## 🎨 Animation Timeline

```
Time 0s: Text appears (alpha = 1.0, fully visible)
    ↓
Time 0-3s: Text stays visible
    ↓
Time 3s: Fade out begins
    ↓
Time 3-4s: Text fades (alpha 1.0 → 0.0)
    ↓
Time 4s: Text fully transparent and cleared
```

---

## 🎛️ Customization Options

### In GameManager Inspector:

**Fade Text Display Duration:**
- **Default:** 3 seconds
- **Range:** Any positive value
- **Shorter (1-2s):** Quick flash messages
- **Longer (4-5s):** More time to read

### Fade Out Duration:

Currently hardcoded to 1 second. To change:

Edit `GameManager.cs` line ~945:
```csharp
float fadeOutDuration = 1f; // Change this value
```

---

## 📊 Message Examples

### Boss Defeated:
```
Message: "Boss Defeated!"
Trigger: Boss health reaches 0
Duration: 3s visible + 1s fade
```

### Loot Collected:
```
Message: "Double Swords added to inventory"
Trigger: Player collects loot
Duration: 3s visible + 1s fade
Customizable: Change "Item Name" in LootPickup component
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### ShowFadeText() Method:

```csharp
public void ShowFadeText(string message)
{
    // Stops any existing fade animation
    // Starts new fade coroutine
    // Shows message with fade effect
}
```

### Features:
- **Auto-stops previous messages** (no overlap)
- **Smooth fade in/out** (lerp interpolation)
- **Fully customizable** (duration, text, timing)
- **Safe** (checks if fadeText is assigned)

---

## 🎮 Testing

### Quick Test:

1. **Assign fadeText** to GameManager
2. **Enter Play Mode**
3. **Skip to Boss Phase** (debug menu)
4. **Kill Boss:**
   - ✅ "Boss Defeated!" appears at top
   - ✅ Text stays for 3 seconds
   - ✅ Text fades out smoothly
5. **Collect Loot:**
   - ✅ "Double Swords added to inventory" appears
   - ✅ Text stays for 3 seconds
   - ✅ Text fades out smoothly

### Expected Console Output:

```
GameManager: Boss defeated! Starting victory sequence...
[fadeText shows "Boss Defeated!"]

GameManager: Loot collected 'Double Swords'. Total: 1/1
[fadeText shows "Double Swords added to inventory"]
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### No Text Appears

**Check:**
- [ ] fadeText is assigned in GameManager Inspector
- [ ] fadeText GameObject is active
- [ ] Canvas is in scene
- [ ] Console shows: "fadeText UI element not assigned!" (if not assigned)

### Text Appears But Doesn't Fade

**Check:**
- [ ] fadeText has Text component
- [ ] Text color has alpha channel
- [ ] No other scripts controlling fadeText

### Text Too Fast/Slow

**Adjust:**
- GameManager → UI References → **Fade Text Display Duration**
- Increase for longer display
- Decrease for quicker messages

### Multiple Messages Overlap

**This shouldn't happen** - ShowFadeText() stops previous coroutines
- If it does, check for multiple GameManager instances

---

## 💡 Adding More Messages

### To add custom messages anywhere:

```csharp
// From any script:
GameManager.Instance.ShowFadeText("Your custom message here!");
```

### Examples:

```csharp
// Phase transition
GameManager.Instance.ShowFadeText("Entering Combat Zone");

// Enemy defeated
GameManager.Instance.ShowFadeText("Enemy Defeated");

// Health low
GameManager.Instance.ShowFadeText("Health Critical!");

// Checkpoint reached
GameManager.Instance.ShowFadeText("Checkpoint Saved");
```

---

## 🎨 UI Styling

The fadeText element can be styled in Unity:

### Recommended Settings:

```
Text Component:
├─ Font: Bold, large size (30-40)
├─ Alignment: Center, Top
├─ Color: White (or yellow for important messages)
├─ Shadow/Outline: For better visibility
└─ Anchor: Top-Center of Canvas
```

### Position:

- **Top of screen** (current setup)
- **Center** (for critical messages)
- **Bottom** (for less important info)
