## üìã Part 1: Cinematic Camera Setup (10 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Create Cinematic Camera System

Create these GameObjects in hierarchy:

```
Hierarchy:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _BossCinematic (empty parent)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SimpleCinematicCamera (empty GameObject)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pose_1_WideShot (empty GameObject)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Pose_2_MediumShot (empty GameObject)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Pose_3_CloseUp (empty GameObject)
```

### Step 1.2: Configure SimpleCinematicCamera

1. Select **SimpleCinematicCamera** GameObject
2. Add **SimpleCinematicCamera** component
3. Configure:

#### Camera
- **Cinematic Camera:** Drag **Main Camera** (the one with Camera component)

#### Cinematic Poses
- **Poses:** Size = 3
  - Element 0: Drag **Pose_1_WideShot**
  - Element 1: Drag **Pose_2_MediumShot**
  - Element 2: Drag **Pose_3_CloseUp**

#### Player Control
- **Player:** Leave empty (auto-finds by "Player" tag)

### Step 1.3: Position and Configure Poses

#### Pose_1_WideShot (Boss Reveal)

1. Select **Pose_1_WideShot**
2. Add **SimpleCinematicPose** component
3. Configure:
   - **Field Of View:** 70
   - **Transition Duration:** 0.5 (quick cut)
   - **Ease Curve:** EaseInOut
   - **Hold Duration:** 1.5
   - **Look At Target:** Drag your **Boss** GameObject

4. **Position in Scene:**
   - Place camera to show full boss (wide shot)
   - Position: e.g., 10 units away from boss
   - Height: e.g., 2 units above ground
   - Rotate to face boss (or leave if using Look At Target)

#### Pose_2_MediumShot (Boss Face/Upper Body)

1. Select **Pose_2_MediumShot**
2. Add **SimpleCinematicPose** component
3. Configure:
   - **Field Of View:** 50
   - **Transition Duration:** 1.5 (slow zoom)
   - **Ease Curve:** EaseInOut
   - **Hold Duration:** 1.5
   - **Look At Target:** Drag your **Boss** GameObject

4. **Position in Scene:**
   - Place camera closer to boss (medium shot)
   - Position: e.g., 5 units away from boss
   - Height: e.g., at boss head level
   - Frame boss upper body/face

#### Pose_3_CloseUp (Dramatic Close-up or Player Reaction)

1. Select **Pose_3_CloseUp**
2. Add **SimpleCinematicPose** component
3. Configure:
   - **Field Of View:** 60
   - **Transition Duration:** 1.0
   - **Ease Curve:** EaseInOut
   - **Hold Duration:** 1.0
   - **Look At Target:** Drag **Boss** or **Player** GameObject

4. **Position in Scene:**
   - Place camera for dramatic angle
   - Option A: Very close to boss face
   - Option B: Behind boss looking at player
   - Experiment with positioning!

**Important:** Use Scene view to position poses. The GameObject's transform IS the camera position/rotation!

## üìã Part 2: Boss AI Controller Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 2.1: Configure Boss GameObject

1. Select your **Boss** GameObject
2. Ensure it has these components:
   - `vControlAIMelee` (Invector AI)
   - `vFSMBehaviourController` (Invector FSM)
   - `BossAIController` (our script)
   - `Animator` (main animator)
   - `EnemyDeathNotifier` (to notify GameManager on death)

### Step 2.2: Setup Boss Animators

#### Main Animator
- This is your boss's regular animator with all combat animations
- Should have: Idle, Walk, Run, Attack animations
- **Keep enabled** in hierarchy

#### Roar Animator (Optional but Recommended)
1. Create child GameObject under Boss: "RoarAnimator"
2. Add **Animator** component
3. Assign animator controller with ONLY roar animation
4. **Disable** this animator in hierarchy (BossAIController will enable it)

### Step 2.3: Configure BossAIController Component

Select Boss ‚Üí BossAIController component:

#### Boss State
- **Is Activated:** ‚úó Unchecked (starts inactive)
- **Has Reached Player Once:** ‚úó Unchecked

#### Components
- **Main Animator:** Drag boss's main Animator component
- **Roar Animator:** Drag RoarAnimator child's Animator (if you created one)
- **Roar Trigger Name:** "Roar" (must match trigger parameter in roar animator)

#### FSM Behaviour
- **Simple Behaviour:** Drag your SIMPLE FSM behaviour asset
  - This should make boss walk slowly towards player
  - No attacks, just menacing approach
- **Complex Behaviour:** Drag your COMPLEX FSM behaviour asset
  - This is your full combat behaviour (attacks, combos, etc.)

#### Behavior Transition
- **Combat Activation Distance:** 5.0
  - Boss switches from simple to complex when within this distance

#### Movement Speed Settings
- **Menacing Walk Speed:** 1.5 (slow, scary approach)
- **Normal Walk Speed:** 2.5
- **Run Speed:** 4.5
- **Sprint Speed:** 6.0

## üìã Part 3: GameManager Integration (5 minutes)

### Step 3.1: Configure GameManager Boss Fight Setup

1. Select **GameManager** GameObject
2. Find **Boss Fight Setup** section
3. Configure:

#### Boss Fight Setup
- **Boss Controller:** Drag your **Boss** GameObject (with BossAIController)
- **Boss Cinematic Camera:** Drag **SimpleCinematicCamera** GameObject
- **Boss Roar SFX:** Assign roar sound effect AudioClip

That's it! GameManager will automatically:
1. Trigger cinematic when transitioning to Boss phase
2. Play camera sequence through poses
3. Play roar SFX
4. Trigger roar animation
5. Activate boss with simple behaviour
6. Boss will auto-switch to complex behaviour when close

---

## üìã Part 4: Create FSM Behaviours (20 minutes)

### Step 4.1: Create Simple Behaviour

1. In Project window, navigate to `Assets/Prefabs/FSMBehaviour/`
2. Right-click ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Invector ‚Üí FSM ‚Üí FSM Behaviour
3. Name it: "SimpleBossBehaviour"
4. Double-click to open FSM editor
5. Create this simple state machine:

```
States:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Idle (default state)
‚îÇ   Actions: None
‚îÇ   Transitions:
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ If "Player In Range" ‚Üí Chase
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Chase
    Actions:
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Chase Target (follow player slowly)
    Transitions:
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ If "Player Out of Range" ‚Üí Idle
```

**Key Points:**
- NO attack actions
- Just chase/follow player
- Slow movement (BossAIController sets speed)

### Step 4.2: Create Complex Behaviour

1. Right-click ‚Üí Create ‚Üí Invector ‚Üí FSM ‚Üí FSM Behaviour
2. Name it: "ComplexBossBehaviour"
3. This is your full combat behaviour
4. Include:
   - Chase state
   - Attack states (melee attacks)
   - Combo states
   - Dodge/Block states (if needed)
   - Death state

**Use your existing CustomDemonBehaviour or create new one**
