# ✅ Blockchain Integration Complete!

## What's Been Set Up

### 🎯 Smart Contracts Created

1. **BossLog.sol** - Records boss kills on-chain
   - Emits `BossKilled` events with full run data
   - Idempotency protection (prevents duplicate recordings)
   - Owned by coordinator wallet

2. **Relic721.sol** - ERC-721 NFT for in-game items
   - Mints relics with dynamic attributes
   - Metadata stored on IPFS
   - Fully transferable (tradeable)
   - Events: `RelicMinted`

3. **PlayerCardSBT.sol** - Soul-Bound Token for player identity
   - Non-transferable player cards
   - Auto-mints on first progress update
   - Updates rank, level, XP on-chain
   - Events: `PlayerCardMinted`, `ProgressUpdated`

### 🔧 Backend Integration

✅ **ChainService** - Core blockchain operations
- `emitBossKilled()` - Records boss kills
- `mintRelic()` - Mints relic NFTs
- `updatePlayerProgress()` - Updates player SBT
- Uses environment contract addresses

✅ **BlockchainIntegrationService** - Advanced operations
- `batchMintRelics()` - Mints multiple relics efficiently
- `batchUpdateProgress()` - Updates multiple players
- Error handling and retry logic
- Transaction receipt verification

✅ **RunsService** - Game flow integration
- Complete run finish flow
- Automatic XP/level/rank calculation
- Blockchain transaction execution
- Inventory cache updates
- Idempotency support

### 📋 Deployment Steps

**1. Install Contract Dependencies:**
```bash
cd apps/core/contracts
npm install
```

**2. Get Test ETH:**
Visit: https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet
Send test ETH to your coordinator wallet address

**3. Deploy Contracts:**
```bash
cd apps/core/contracts
npm run deploy:sepolia
```

**4. Update `.env` with Contract Addresses:**
```env
BOSS_LOG_ADDRESS=0x... (from deployment output)
RELIC_721_ADDRESS=0x... (from deployment output)
PLAYER_CARD_SBT_ADDRESS=0x... (from deployment output)
```

**5. Restart Backend:**
```bash
cd apps/core
pnpm dev
```

You should see:
```
📝 Contract Addresses Loaded:
  BossLog: 0x...
  Relic721: 0x...
  PlayerCardSBT: 0x...
```

### 🎮 Complete Run Flow (When Contracts Deployed)

```
1. Players join party
2. Party starts → creates Run
3. Combat happens (Colyseus handles this)
4. POST /runs/:runId/finish with contributions
   ↓
5. Backend processes:
   ✅ Calculate XP/levels/ranks
   ✅ Generate relic rewards
   ✅ Execute blockchain transactions:
      → BossLog.emitBossKilled()
      → Relic721.mint() for each relic
      → PlayerCardSBT.updateProgress() for each player
   ✅ Update inventory cache
   ✅ Update player profiles
   ✅ Store transaction hashes
   ↓
6. Return results:
   {
     "ok": true,
     "data": {
       "txHash": "0xabc...",
       "relics": [{ "tokenId": 1, "cid": "Qm..." }]
     }
   }
```

### 🧪 Testing Without Contracts

If you haven't deployed contracts yet (addresses are 0x000...000):
- The backend will attempt to mint but will fail
- You can still test the flow logic
- The run will be saved to MongoDB
- The frontend will receive mock data

### 🧪 Testing With Contracts

Once contracts are deployed:
1. Complete a run through the UI
2. Check transaction on BaseScan
3. Verify NFTs were minted
4. Check player SBT updated
5. View relics in inventory

### 📊 Monitoring Blockchain Operations

The backend logs will show:
```
✅ BossKilled event emitted: 0xabc...
✅ Relic minted: tokenId=1, txHash=0xdef...
✅ Player progress updated: 0x123..., txHash=0xghi...
```

### 🔗 Verification

After deployment, verify contracts on BaseScan:
```bash
cd apps/core/contracts
npm run verify
```

This makes your contract source code public and verifiable.

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Deploy contracts** to Base Sepolia
2. **Fund coordinator wallet** with test ETH
3. **Test run finish flow** end-to-end
4. **Verify minting** on BaseScan
5. **Check inventory** reflects minted relics

All blockchain infrastructure is ready - just deploy the contracts and add their addresses to `.env`! 🎉
